..	glossary::
	:sorted:

	ACL
		**Access Control List.** 
		
		An ACL determines what networking traffic is allowed to pass and what traffic is blocked.
		
		An ACL change is sometimes required to your company firewall in order to access our API.
	
	API

		See `Wikipedia - API Definition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_ for 
		more information.
		
	B2B
		**Business To(2) Business**
		
		Business email hosting services are generally private, 
		enterprise grade hosting services typically hosted in either 
		private data centers or in cloud based infrastructure.
		
		Business to business refers to the activity of businesses
		sending email to clients using business email addresses.
		
	B2C
		**Business To(2) Consumer**
		
		Consumer email hosting providers are generally well known, 
		mostly web based providers such as Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, Gmail etc.
		
		Business to consumer refers to the activity of businesses
		sending email to clients using consumer email addresses.
		
		Verifying email addresses in consumer domains is generally more 
		technically challenging than :term:`B2B`
	
	Block list
		See :term:`DNSBL`.
	
	BSON
		**Binary Object Notation**
		
		See `Wikipedia - BSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON>`_ 
		for further information.
	
	CORS
		**Cross Origin Resource Scripting**
		
		Allows modern browsers to work with script (e.g. JavaScript) and :term:`JSON` data 
		originating form other domains.
		
		CORS is required to allow client script such a JavaScript, jQuery or AngularJS to 
		work with results returned from an external :term:`RESTful` :term:`API`.
		
		See `Wikipedia - CORS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>`_ for 
		more information.
	
	DDoS

		more information.
	
	DEA
		**Disposable Email Address**
		
		There are many services available that permit users to 
		use a one-time only email address. Typically, these email 
		addresses are used by individuals wishing to gain access 
		to content or services requiring registration of email 
		addresses but same individuals not wishing to divulge 
		their true identities (e.g. permanent email addresses).

		DEA addresses should not be regarded as valid for email 
		send purposes as it is unlikely that messages sent to 
		DEA addresses will ever be read.

	ESP
		**Email Service Provider**
		
		A service that sends emails on your behalf.
		
		See 
		`Wikipedia - Email service provider (marketing) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_service_provider_(marketing)>`_ for 
		more information.

	HTTP
		**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
		
		See `Wikipedia - Hypertext Transfer Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>`_ for 
		more information.
	
	Grey listing
		A technique used in mail servers as an anti-spam technique.
		Sometimes also known as \"deferred\", grey listing arbitrarily 
		delays the delivery of emails with a \"try again later\" response 
		to the client sending the email.
		
		See `Wikipedia - Grey Listing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting>`_ for more 
		information.
		
	JSON
		**JavaScript Object Notation**
		
		JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format that uses 
		human readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute value pairs. 
		It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, 
		as an efficient, modern alternative to XML.
		
		See `Wikipedia - JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ for more information.
		
	License key
		License key authentication is best for situations
		where simplicity is required and you can keep the key private.
		An ideal use case for key authentication would be for server 
		based applications calling the RESTful :term:`API`.
		
		`Click here <https://api.emailverifyapi.com/GetLicense>`_ to request a license key.
	
	DNS
		**Domain Name System**
		
		At its simplest level, DNS converts text based queries (e.g. a domain name) 
		into IP addresses.
		
		DNS is also responsible for providing the :term:`MX` records needed to locate a
		domains mail servers.
		
		See `Wikipedia - Domain Name System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System>`_ 
		for more information.
	
	DNSBL
		**DNS Block List**
		
		As an anti-spam measure, mail servers can use spam black lists 
		to 'look up' the reputation of IP addresses and domains sending 
		email. If an IP or domain is on a block list, the mail server may 
		reject the senders email message.
		
		See `Wikipedia - DNSBL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL>`_ for more information.

		**Mail Exchanger**
		
		The MX is a server responsible for email interchange with a client.
	
	NDR
		**Non Delivery Report**
		
		A message that is returned to sender stating that delivery of an email address was not possible.
		
		See `Wikipedia - Bounce message <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message>`_ for more information.
	
	Office 365
		Office 365 mail servers (e.g. x-com.mail.protection.outlook.com) are always configured 
		with the catch all policy, accepting all emails sent to the domain and redirecting them 
		to a central email box for manual inspection. Catch all configured servers cannot 
		respond to requests for email address verification.
		
		This does not affect our coverage of Hotmail, Live and Outlook mailboxes.
	
	protobuf
		Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data.
	
		See `Wikipedia - Protocol Buffers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers>`_ for more information.

		the sending and receiving of email between computer based email messaging systems.
