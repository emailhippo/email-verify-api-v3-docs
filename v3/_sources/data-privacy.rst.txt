Compliance
==========

We're BIG on security.

If you are using the Email Hippo More API you need to be confident that your data is safe and that the processing is secure. Email Hippo security processes are accredited to the ISO 27001 standard; the highest independently assessed standard that is internationally recognised.

In addition to our stringent security processes, it is relevant to note: 
* All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS.
* All data at rest (e.g. stored for caching and reporting purposes) is secured using AES-265 bit encryption.

If you have any questions regarding data security, our processing terms or any compliance related question please contact our Data Protection Officer; DPO@emailhippo.com
